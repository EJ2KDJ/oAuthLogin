# OAuth 2.0 Login Mini Project

A lightweight Node.js + Express application that implements a simple **Google OAuth 2.0 login** using Passport.js.

## 🔍 What the Project Demonstrates

- Google OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow  
- Integrating Google Login with Passport.js  
- Managing user sessions using `express-session`  
- User serialization and deserialization for session handling  

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of my backend development practice to strengthen my understanding of:

- Third-party authentication  
- OAuth flow  
- Session management and user state handling  

It also serves as a foundation for future applications that require secure user authentication.
